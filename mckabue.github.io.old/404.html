					<p>My name is Kabue Charles Njogu. Kabue was born on 29th July, 1992. I live in kenya,
					where i was born. I am a Christian, and i like being fair to everyone, including animals.
					Kabue is motivated by very minute events, and he is touched by the least of kindness...
					He struggles to stay calm and is always trying to look cool. I like believing that i can
					play a guitar...I like watching movies...I like playing chess...I dont like reading big, or small
					books...And i have a vision, a vision that one day, one day i will be great.
