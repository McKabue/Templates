					<h1>School</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionContent2">
					<p>After my first breath in 1992, I was taken to Kiriko primary because it was the nearest school to home and it was cheap since it was, and still is a public school. It was 1998 when I stepped in my first class, nursery school. I looked very bright (and by the way I was…) since I managed to become number one at the end of the year. I was rewarded a present, or a gift, or a kettle, a big kettle to be precise. Since then, (you better be ready for this…) since that time I was number one, the closest I’ve ever been to number one was when I was the leading student in geography (which I chose because I wanted to do something related to aviation – to be a pilot!!!) in Chinga boys High School. I know I possibly will never be the first in anything, given the well proven fate in poetry, athletics, soccer, martial arts, academics, conduct, personality, music including many more….but I also know at least I tried all I could, and was never the last. In fact, am always among the top half!!</p>
					<p>Now am in campus [11:58 am; June 14, 2014], where I am happily enjoying my fate. I am taking Software Engineering, which in fact, I consciously decided to choose while in high school. Yeah, I know you question…I talked of wanting to be a pilot. Here is the story that resulted to change of a dream, change of plan is a better substitute. I was in form two when a Kenyan plane went missing in the Congo forests…days of searching, lead to weeks without hope of any survivor! And I was like, “me and planes, we are divorced, divorced for real”. I had already dropped computer as a choice but I wanted to be like those hackers in the movies…cracking software’s, controlling CCTV cameras, spying people, (I will write more soon)… many of my friends did computer science, applied computer science, computer engineering, information technology, and many other famous, huge and respectable computer courses… due to my personal experience, fate favors me when I act different. One thing lead to another, the “another” was me choosing SOFTWARE ENGINNERING. But my high school grade could only invited me to a constituent college of Egerton University, which the former president Kibaki declared a full public University, among other twenty-something constituent colleges. </p>

					<h1>My Fate</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionContent2">
					<p>Fate, (as I uniquely and personally define it) is a controller or a system that works to ensure fairness and equality! Fates works under assumption that saying “yes” to one thing means saying “no” to another. Fate has children, who include coincidence, and luck. Fate was created by God to do what it does best, just like God created human to procreate, so that He don’t have to create new species now and then… fate believes I should get what I need, not what I want. But something scares me…how my ATM card refused withdraw money when I had planned to buy something I never needed, how I want something A and get B (almost always…), and…</p>

					<h1>Faith/Believes</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionContent2">
					<p>Now here comes the fun part, my believes! I believe in doing what is right! I believe we are all equal. I believe everything is inter connected to everything, directly or indirectly. I believe in fate. I believe in a predefined way that life follows. I believe in a supreme being. I believe in God. I believe in Christ. I believe in the Holy Spirit of God. I believe in hard work. I believe in kindness. I believe there is heaven and hell. I believe in common sense, yeah, you heard me right, common sense!! Why did God insert common sense inside of humans and did not intend us to use it?? (…food for thought, food for thought!!)</p>
					<p>Now my faith gets its space of expression. I believe the in the Trinity. God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. According to my own understanding, God the Father is the Soul, God the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God the Father, same as humans have a soul and a spirit. And God the Son is the body, or rather the space/place where God the Father and God the Spirit live in. in the beginning when God the Father created the universe, He said, “let US”, note the “us” does not include angels, but He talked of His Equal, who are the Spirit and the Son. He never wanted to create a creature dependent on spirit, or the body. He created a three-in-one human…the soul (which is the sub-conscience part that tells us we are doing wrong or not. Animals can’t, because they don’t have a soul, that’s why they are not included in the journey to heaven), the spirit (which defines whether we are Christians, Hindu, Muslim, bad, good, kind. This is the part that will either go to hell or heaven) and the brain (which is part of the body. This is where God released dependence and gave us a free-will to choose what we want)</p>
					<p>We all have the same soul, what matter is how active it is, or how weak your free-will choices have made it. This explains why all kinds are innocent, regardless of where they are born. If I was born in a Muslim family, I would be a Muslim. I would believe in Mohammed. Same as if I was born in a Hindu family. But saying that only Christians will go to heaven is wrong!! If there is heaven, we’ll all go. Not all including serial killers (they should certainly deserve a place of their own, which can’t be heaven, although they do what they do because of some factors, reasons, environments, mental torture, and many more reasons which if possibly we passed through them, we would possibly be worse than them). I mean, all good, righteous, upright, king, loving and … will have what is good, whether is going to heaven, or a place better!!</p>

					<h1>Wishes/Hopes</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionContent2">
					<p>One day, which can’t be tomorrow, I will start a children’s home. My wish is that even after my time on earth expires, these children will have a school to go, and a hospital that attends them. That’s my long term wish, and I hope am dreaming a reality, otherwise I will prove it wrong!</p>
					<p>Currently, all I wish is that I will remain as contented as I am. As happy as I am. As human as I am. As healthy as I am. And as sane as I am.</p>

					<h1>Interests</h1>
				</div>
				<div class="sectionContent2">
					<p>I like pretending I can still sing, or in simpler words, I used to sing out loud at night when I was in high school, and even after. One of my greatest drawbacks are my friends! They tell me I sound bad, but strangers admit am a great artist. And wait, who said I care if you like how I sing or not, am usually happy when I sing meaning I don’t sing for a compliment. Anyway, sorry for those true words…</p>
					<p>I have, or at least can play I guitar, and have always desired to touch a violin, because I have never!</p>
					<p>I enjoy being in new places, for whatever reason am there; I like watching movies, where my favorites include Merlin, Vampire Diaries, Legend of the seeker, Person of interest and many others of that kind (that is as of UPTO 2014); I like being the opposite of what or how am expected; and above all, I like speechless moments; I value silence; and above all, I enjoy a moment of prayer and programming!!</p>
